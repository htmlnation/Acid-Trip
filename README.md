# Acid-Trip
This is one of my first and favorite .hta files I made. I don't know why but I like to start it up, spared it onto two monitors and just look at it. You can and should adjust the window on it and enjoy. Hit the Esc key to close it. The app will start off small in the upper left of your screen. You will not be able to drag it around with the current setting but you can size the window.
